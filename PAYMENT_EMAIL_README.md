## Technical Implementation

```dart
Future<void> sendPaymentConfirmationEmail({
  required String receiverEmail,
  required String studentName,
  required String receiptNumber,
  required double amount,
  required String purpose,
  required String academicYear,
  required String semester,
  required DateTime paymentDate,
  required File receiptPdf,
  required Map<String, dynamic> paymentData,
}) async
```

### PDF Receipt Service (`lib/services/pdf_receipt_service.dart`)

  required AcademicFeeModel fee,
  required UserModel user,
}) async
```

**Features:**
- Generates professional PDF receipt
- Includes university branding and watermark
- Attaches PDF to email automatically
- Handles errors gracefully

### Integration Points

#### 1. Payment Success Flow
- **Location**: `lib/controllers/academic_fees_controller.dart`
- **Method**: `processPayment()`
- **Trigger**: After successful SSL Commerz payment
- **Action**: Automatically sends confirmation email

```dart
// Send payment confirmation email
try {
  await PdfReceiptService.generateAndEmailReceipt(
    fee: updatedFee,
    user: currentUser,
  );
  print('Payment confirmation email sent successfully');
} catch (e) {
  print('Failed to send payment confirmation email: $e');
  // Don't block the payment success flow if email fails
}
```

#### 2. Manual Email Sending
- **Payment Success Screen**: "Send Email Receipt" button
- **Academic Fees Screen**: "Send Email Receipt" button for paid fees
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback if email fails

## Configuration

### SMTP Settings
The email service uses Gmail SMTP with the following configuration:
- **Server**: smtp.gmail.com
- **Port**: 465
- **SSL**: Enabled
- **Authentication**: Username/password

### Email Credentials
```dart
// Configure in EmailService constructor
username: 'your-email@gmail.com'
password: 'your-app-password'
```

**Note**: Use Gmail App Passwords for security. Regular passwords won't work with 2FA enabled.

## Error Handling

### Email Failures
- **Non-blocking**: Email failures don't prevent payment completion
- **User Notification**: Clear error messages for users
- **Logging**: Detailed error logging for debugging
- **Retry Options**: Manual retry buttons available

### Common Issues
1. **SMTP Authentication**: Check Gmail app password
2. **Network Issues**: Handle connectivity problems
3. **PDF Generation**: Fallback to print preview if file operations fail
4. **Email Limits**: Gmail sending limits (500/day for regular accounts)

## Testing

### Test Scenarios
1. **Successful Payment**: Verify email sends automatically
2. **Manual Email**: Test "Send Email Receipt" buttons
3. **Error Handling**: Test with invalid email addresses
4. **PDF Attachment**: Verify receipt PDF is properly attached
5. **Email Content**: Check all payment details are correct

### Test Commands
```bash
# Run email service tests
flutter test test/email_service_test.dart

# Test payment flow
# 1. Make a test payment
# 2. Check email delivery
# 3. Verify PDF attachment
```

## Security Considerations

### Email Security

- **App Passwords**: Secure Gmail authentication
- **No Sensitive Data**: Payment details are safe for email

### PDF Security
- **Watermark**: "PAID" watermark on receipts
- **Official Format**: Professional university branding
